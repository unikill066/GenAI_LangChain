A collection of hands-on Jupyter notebooks completed as part of the **AI Agents with LangGraph** course by **Harrison Chase** and **Andrew Ng** on **DeepLearning.AI**. These lessons explore building, extending, and deploying agentic systems using the LangGraph framework and large language models.

## Table of Contents
1. Lesson 1: Simple ReAct Agent from Scratch
2. Lesson 2: LangGraph Components
3. Lesson 3: Agentic Search & How it is different from regular search
4. Lesson 4: Persistence and Streaming
5. Lesson 5: Human in the Loop Agentic System
6. Lesson 6: Essay Writer Agent

## Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.10+**
2. **Jupyter Lab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
3. API access to a large language model (e.g., OpenAI API key) and a search engine (e.g., Tavily API key)
4. Familiarity with basic Python programming and machine learning concepts

## Installation
1. **Download the Notebooks**
2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
4. **Configure your API key**

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"    # macOS/Linux
   set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"       # Windows
   export TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key_here"    # macOS/Linux
   set TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key_here"       # Windows
   ```

## Usage
1. **Start Jupyter Lab**

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
2. **Open the lesson notebooks**
   Click on any `Lesson_*.ipynb` file to launch the interactive environment.
3. **Run cells in order**
   Follow the instructions in each notebook, modifying parameters or code as desired.
